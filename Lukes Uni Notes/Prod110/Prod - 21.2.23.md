**Drawing**
- Visualisation 
	- Using lines to visualise an idea or form.
- Communication 
	- Using notes to explain or communicate a form.
- Documentation 
	- Future proofing and making it legal.

**Types of drawing**
- Artistic drawing
	- Personal drawing 
- Concept sketch
	- Ideation techniques used to convey a concept using perspective techniques to show your idea.
- Thematic sketching
	- Functions of your idea and movement or how it works. How humans interact with the device.
- Schematic Sketches
	- Less details and used to show theory. Uses standard symbols or patterns so that others can replicate it.
- Technical Drawing
	- More complicated, more detail and often used to finalise a concept.


**Applications**
- Architecture and civil engineering
	- Building houses, construction, and layouts.
- Mechanical
	- Simulation and manufacturing purposes.
- Product design
	- Communication new and innovative ideas.
- Game Art and Animation
	- Characters and game enviroments.

Techniques
- Perspective Projection
	- An approximate representation of distance.
	- Objects smaller as distance changes
	- Images of roads, railways or streets
- Parallel Isometric Projection
	- 30 degrees and all lines parrallel
- Parallel Oblique Projection
	- Different angles used and different depths used to represent different drawing types.
