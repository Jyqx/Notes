**Writing exercise**
My name is Luke Donaldson-Scott and I am good at any sport and enjoy anything digital. I hate writing and reading even though my mum is an english teacher but I like to code and get help from my dad who is a software engineer. I wanted to go down the same path as my dad but failed calculus and physics so I am now taking this new course. It was a coincidence that this course came about the year I failed the classes I needed for univerisity. My life has been pretty bland to say the least and significant moments have never really happened in my life the most significant part of my life was probably being born. I am a very anxious person and find social events stressful most people just think im quiet but I have to get to know you really well to open up. My family can be very strict and sometimes not strict at all which is very annoying when it comes to trying to be social.
